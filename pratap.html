    <p>The Maratha ruler Shivaji assigned Moropant Trimbak Pingle<br>
       his prime minister, to undertake the construction of this <br>
       fort in order to defend the banks of the Nira and the Koyna <br>
       rivers, and to defend the Par pass. It was completed in 1656.<br>

      The Battle of Pratapgad between Shivaji and Afzal Khan, a general of Adil Shahi dynasty <br>
       was fought below the ramparts of this fort on 10 November 1659. <br>
       This was the first major test of the fledgling kingdom's army <br>
       and set the stage of the establishment of the Maratha empire.<br>
        
        Pratapgad continued to be involved in regional politics.Sakharam Bapu Bokil<br>
         a well-known minister of Pune, was confined by his rival Nana Phadnis in Pratapgad in 1778.<br>
          He was later moved from fort to fort until he died at Raigad. In 1796, Nana Phadnis,<br>
           while escaping from the intrigues of Daulatrao Shinde and his minister Baloba,<br>
            assembled a strong garrison in Pratapgad before heading to Mahad.<br>
             In 1818, as part of the Third Anglo-Maratha War, Pratapgad surrendered by private negotiation.<br>
              This was a great loss to the Maratha forces, as Pratapgad was an important stronghold,<br>
               had a large garrison, and could suppress much of the country around Wai.
