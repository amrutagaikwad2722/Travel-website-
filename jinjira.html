    <h1>Jinjira Fort</h1>
    <h2>Most Beautiful Fort</h2>
    <b><p>Raja Ram Rao Patil was Patil of Janjira Island and a chief of Kolis<br>Kolis tolive peacefully away from pirates. <br>
        After gaining permission from the<br>
      Sultan of the Ahmadnagar Sultanate, he built the island but later refused <br>
      to obey the orders of the Sultan. So the Sultan sent his Admiral Piram Khan<br>
       to capture the janjira. Due to the castle's fortifications, Piram Khan was<br>
       unable to attack the island conventionally, so he disguised himself as a <br>
       merchant and requested to stay a night at janjira and permission was granted.<br>
        Piram Khan hosted a party under the guise of thanking the Patil.<br>
         When the Patil and kolis were intoxicated, Piram Khan attacked them <br>
         with his men who had been hidden in barrels and captured the island.
