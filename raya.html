        <h1>Raigad</h1>
    <b><p>Raigad is a hill fort situated in Mahad, Raigad district of Maharashtra, India.<br>
         It is one of the strongest fortresses on the Deccan Plateau. <br>
         It was previously known as Rairee or Rairy fort.<br>

        Many constructions and structures on Raigad were built by Shivaji <br>
         the Chief Engineer was Hiroji Indulkar.<br>
         When Shivaji made it his capital in 1674 upon being<br>
          crowned the king of the Maratha kingdom,<br>
          which later developed into the Maratha Empire,<br>
           eventually covering much of western and central India.<br>

        
        The fort rises 820 metres (2,700 ft) above base level and 1356 m<br>
         above sea level in the Sahyadri mountain range.<br>
         There are approximately 1,737 steps leading to the fort. <br>
         The Raigad Ropeway, an aerial tramway,<br>
          reaches 400 meters in height and 750 meters in length, <br>
          and allows visitors to reach the fort from the ground in only four minutes.
