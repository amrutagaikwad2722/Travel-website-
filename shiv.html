  <h1>Place of Chatrpati</h1>
  
  <b><p>Shivneri is known to be a place of Buddhist dominion from the 1st century AD. <br>
    Its caves, rock-cut architecture and water system indicate the presence of<br>
    habitation since 1st century AD. Shivneri got its name as it was under the <br>
    possession of the Yadavas of Devagiri. This fort was mainly used to guard the <br>
    old trading route from Desh to the port city of Kalyan. The place passed on to<br>
    the Bahmani Sultanate after the weakening of Delhi Sultanate during the 15th century<br>
    and it then passed on to the Ahmadnagar Sultanate in the 16th century. In 1595,<br>
    a Maratha chief named Maloji Bhonsle, the grandfather of Shivaji Bhosale,<br>
    was enabled by the Ahmadnagar Sultan, Bahadur Nizam Shah and he gave him Shivneri and Chakan.<br>
    Shivaji was born at the fort on 19 February 1630 (some accounts place it 1627), and spent his childhood there.<br>
    Inside the fort is a small temple dedicated to the goddess Shivai Devi, after whom Shivaji was named. The English <br>
    traveller Fraze visited the fort in 1673 and found it invincible. According to his accounts, the fort was well-stocked<br>
    to feed thousand families for seven years. The fort came under the control of the British Rule<br>
     in 1820 after the Third Anglo-Maratha War.<br>
    [citation needed]<br><br>
    In 2021, it was added to the tentative list of the UNESCO World Heritage sites as part of<br>
    "Serial Nomination of Maratha Military Architecture in Maharashtra".<a href="all.html">Back</a><br><br><br><br></p></b>
